Hey folks! How are you doing?

This is a public repository with private hosting and serving, where every 
commit that passes CI is automatically deployed to the production services 
in Google Cloud, which I manage and pay for.

If you're enthusiastic about the topic of streaming analytics, want to challenge 
yourself with the technologies used here or try out new ones, would like to 
get involved, need a platform to showcase your skills, or think you can 
contribute as an advisor, feel free to join! Seriously, folks, the topic may 
seem simple, but itâ€™s just the tip of the iceberg. Check out the developer's 
[guide](DEVELOPERS.md). There are many up-to-date concepts implemented and plenty more 
waiting for contributions (see [roadmap](ROADMAP.md)).

This is a super fun project with incredible variability in Dota 2 matches, countless stats 
and trends to calculate, and so much data to process and apply ML to predict 
match outcomes.

Let's build something amazing together, folks! Whether you're interested in 
backend or frontend development, ML, streaming, Apache Beam, Spark, 
Flink, Kubernetes, CI/CD, or testing, don't hesitate to shoot me a message.
